Entrepreneur An entrepreneur is a person who tries to meet needs of a customer through new ideas or ways of doing business and makes profit in return. New ideas with which an entrepreneur adds value to a business can be of many kinds, including new products — like adding varieties, new services like home delivery or credit services, new marketing ideas, new cost reduction ideas and many more. Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship is a process of developing a business plan,launchingandrunningabusinessusinginnovation to meet customer needs and to make a profit. Letusreadastorytofurtherunderstandthemeaning of entrepreneurship and who is an entrepreneur. Pratap, the Vegetable Seller Pratap was a vegetable seller in Agra. He was well known in the market for always selling fresh vegetables. He used to wake up every morning at 3 am to get there. However, during summers, a lot of his leftover vegetables used to get wasted at the end of the day. To stop this wastage, he started selling the stale vegetables. This earned him a bad name in the market and people stopped going to his shop. Pratap then came-up with an idea! Vegetables home-delivery services — people could order the type and quantity of vegetable they wanted a day before, and Pratap would buy exactly that much from the wholesale market and deliver it fresh to their house. Now his customers do not have to go through the inconvenience of commuting to the market and thus can have the vegetables delivered at their doorstep. All they have to do is call Pratap on his mobile phone and place an order. EmployabilSkill– ClaSSXi 138",375
Page 3,"Questions to think about • How do you think he spotted the opportunity? • How did he serve the needs of the customer? • What would you have done, if you were in Pratap’s place? Do you think Pratap is an entrepreneur? Yes, he is! Pratap was self-employed as a vegetable seller. He solved the customers' problem of getting fresh vegetables at their door-step through a new idea of home- delivery service. Since Pratap used a new way of providing his products to the customer, as a result making their life easier. This makes him an entrepreneur (vs. any normal businessperson). Types of Business Activities Our needs and wants are never constant. They are everchanging. We may want something today but not the same thing tomorrow. For example, Sameer wanted a pair of shoes today but after a few days he wanted a pair of jeans. We can clearly see our wants change over time. Markets provide us with a product in the form of a good or a service Figure 4.1 Types of business activities to meet our specific needs. In the market, different types of businesses exist. The three different types of business activities (Figure 4.1) are as follows: Manufacturing Business A manufacturing business is one that converts raw material(s) into finished product(s) to meet the demands of the customer. In this form of business, the finished product can be directly sold to the customer. Kartik has a factory that produces purified packaged drinking water. This is an example of a manufacturing business. EntrEprEnEurshskills 139",332
Page 4,"Trading Business A trading business does not manufacture a good or product but only facilitates the act of bringing the finished goods from the manufacturing unit to the buyer or customer (who is ready to pay for the produced good) as shown in Figure 4.2. Figure 4.2 Trading business For example, Gupta Pharmacy sells medicines produced or manufactured by different pharmaceutical companies. Gupta pharmacy is a trading business. Services Business Any business activity that is intangible, which cannot be seen and felt, but is for the benefit of a buyer is called a service. Services do not have a fixed time and it is flexible as per the demands of the customers. Services do not even need a shop to sell their products. Amar is a painting contractor as shown in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3 Services business Activity 1 Role-Play — Businesses Around Me! Procedure 1.

S eSSion 2: V alueS of an e ntrepreneur Read the following story and identify actions that make Sunita special. Sunita used to live in Kochi with her parents. During her summer holidays, she went to meet her grandparents who lived in a small town. They were very old and had to take a lot of medicines during the day. They often used EntrEprEnEurshipskills 141",307
Page 6,"to be tired to go to the market to buy their medicines noteS and sometimes forgot to take it, as they did not have help. This affected their health. She then saw that other old people living around face the same problem. Sunita felt very bad about the situation and wanted to help them. Sunita thought of many ways to solve this problem, so that her grandparents and other old people living in the colony remain healthy and get their medicines on time. She then thought of an idea! — to make a special remote, with just one button. This remote would send the signal to the nearest medical shop, who would deliver the medicine within a day. The remote also had an in-built, easy-to-use alarm system which old people could use to set reminders for taking the medicines. Every time the alarm went on, they would take the medicines and turn the alarm off by merely touching the button on the remote. She made this and tried it out at her grandparents’ house, and it worked! They now did not have to travel long distances to buy the medicine or need help to remind them to take their medicines on time. This ‘Remote control’ became very popular in her village and soon, in all of Kerala. She now runs a business and sells these remote controls all over India. Values Values are qualities and principles which make a person think and act in a certain way. From the above example of Sunita, we saw how she felt bad about the problem her grandparents faced and came up with a solution on her own. She thought and made a product that no one had thought of before. Let us find out what qualities makes an entrepreneur successful. Values of an Entrepreneur Each entrepreneur has certain unique qualities that make them successful. As one chooses the path of entrepreneurship, there are various thoughts, fears and doubts that comes to ones’ mind as shown in Figure 4.4. An entrepreneur’s ability to overcome these determines his or her ability to be successful. EmployabiliSkill– laSSXi 142",418
Page 7,"It is the entrepreneur’s values which will therefore help them face and overcome the difficulties and challenges involved in entrepreneurship.

Figure 4.4 Doubts in the mind of an entrepreneur The internal motivation, which allows an entrepreneur to overcome these doubts are called 'values'. Here are some values which make an entrepreneur successful. Confidence Confidence means to believe in one’s self and one’s approach. Being confident helps an entrepreneur to take the first step of starting a new business and then trying new things to grow the business. It pushes the entrepreneur to keep going even if there are failures. Confidence also encourages an entrepreneur to go to customers and ask them for their feedback about the productorservices.Thefeedbackhelpstheentrepreneur to keep improving and growing the business. While being confident is crucial for an entrepreneur, it is also important to keep in mind that the ultimate purpose of an enterprise is to serve the customer, therefore, they should not be over-confident. Being over- confident may lead an entrepreneur to take shortcuts in business, like selling a product while knowing that its quality is bad, or over-charging a customer. Such actions may make the customers distrust the business. Therefore, striking a balance between confidence and over-confidence is one of the most important values of an entrepreneur. EntrEprEnEurshiskills 143",344
Page 8,"noteS Independence Independence means one’s ability to work alone and have the confidence to make one’s own decisions. The responsibility of deciding what work needs to be done and how it can be done is made by the entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is her or his own boss and has to be self-motivated to set goals and follow them. He or she is also responsible for motivating others to work to achieve the goals of the business and keep a check on how the business is performing on a day-to-day basis. While, independence allows an entrepreneur to work alone, with no one to report to, it also comes with the responsibility of ensuring that the customer remains the main focus at all times. Delivering good-quality product or service, at the right price, is one of the primary responsibilities of an entrepreneur. Perseverance Perseverance means not to give up and keep going even when a difficult situation comes up. Running an enterprise, or a business involves many failures. An entrepreneur is responsible to overcome these failures, learn from them and keep going, no matter what happens. The entrepreneur has to stay positive and motivated when things get difficult. While working hard, it is also important for an entrepreneur to think about improvement and growth. This happens when one tries different approaches. Therefore, perseverance does not mean doing the same thing, in the same way again and again. It means to come up with different and innovative ways to overcome difficulties and always thinking about achieving the goal, no matter what comes in the way. Open-mindedness Open-mindedness means to be open to trying new things and being open to other’s feedback. In the process of starting and growing the business, an entrepreneur tries many different things. They will often have to consult others, such as market experts, peers and colleagues EmployabiliSkill– laSSXi 144",382
Page 9,"for information and insights. During this process, it n oteS is important to keep an open-mind and allow for new thoughts and ideas to come your way. This will allow the entrepreneur to learn from failures not just of oneself but also of others and keep improving the business. Case Study Read Poonam’s story and identify which actions made her better than others? Poonam, the Purse-maker Poonam makes handmade purses for women in Odisha. She takes the help of local women who know embroidery to make the purses. Poonam used to sell these in Kolkata. She however, could not sell many pieces and also had to spend a lot of time and money on travelling to Kolkata. Poonam then tried to sell this by going door-to-door but only few more people bought her products. In fact, people were rude and did not talk to her respectfully. However, she did not give up hope and continued to go to more people to sell the purses. She even added new styles and designs to the purses and began making them in different sizes and colours. Then someone told her about a shopping website through which she could sell her products without going to big cities. She immediately registered her company and started getting orders.

They all liked the paintings and asked Surabhi to make and sell more. Surabhi took a loan from the bank to buy more art-supplies so that she could make more paintings. She went to different customers to first understand what they wanted, and then made paintings based on their taste. She now has an art studio where people come to learn how to paint in their free time. She also frequently puts up exhibitions of her work in different places.

Page 16,"Reading the Story Read the story of Kiran and see how she practised thinking like an entrepreneur An entrepreneur needs to think about different ways to solve these problems to become successful. We will learn about what are different ways of thinking like an entrepreneur by reading the story of an entrepreneur from rural India who came up with a different way of solving her customers’ problems. As you read the story, think what Kiran did differently, as compared to other entrepreneurs you know. Also think about how Kiran solves problems. Kiran lived in Gwalior, a town in Madhya Pradesh. Kiran’s father used to sell chaat on on a small handcart. He used to go to different houses to sell the delicious food, which both young and old people enjoyed. Sometimes, Kiran used to go with her father after school to help him. They used to go to different places throughoutthetown.Shehowever,usedtofeelbadwhen she would see her father struggling to turn the hand- cart when they would have to cross narrow lanes. While turning, he had to lift and rotate the cart many times. For a school project, Kiran was asked to make something which would make the life of her parents easy. She thought of solving the problem her father faced with the handcart. She thought of a great idea to make it easy for him to move through narrow lanes. She made a steering system for hand-carts as shown in Figure 4.5, which is controlled by hand, and can be used to lift and rotate the cart. This system was easy and cheap to make, so Kiran started making it with her friends. They would give it to mechanic shops, who would then sell it to people who used handcarts. The product became very popular among a lot of fruits and vegetable sellers, and is now used throughout the country.

Page 17,"Thinking like an Entrepreneur to noteS Solve Problems Entrepreneurs solve many different types of problems in their day-to-day operations. In the above example, Kiran solved the problem of identifying which business idea would he work with. Listed below are three ways most entrepreneurs think when they are trying to solve a problem. Creativity Creativity means to come up with ideas that others have not thought of before. Creativity does not mean being artistic or being good at drawing. An entrepreneur has to believe that they can come up with new ideas to solve a problem. In the case of Kiran, she solved the problem of rotating a handcart by thinking of a new idea. Innovation Innovationmeanstothinkofnewideasandcomeupwith ways to make it work in real life. The difference between creativity and innovation is that while creativity is about just coming up with an idea, innovation is about also coming up with ways to make idea into reality. Kiran’s idea was not just in her head. She made it work by installing the break system in her father’s cart. Critical Thinking Critical thinking means to understand a situation or problem by asking oneself questions (why, what, when, how) and researching about reasons for the situation or a problem. An entrepreneur has to always think critically when faced with a problem. They just cannot getworriedabouttheproblemandnotdoanythingabout it.

Page 19,"S eSSion 5: c oming up with a B uSineSS idea n oteS In the previous session, we learnt about different ways in which an entrepreneur thinks. Starting a new business is very exciting! In order to start and run a successful business, the first step is to come up with an idea. Vivek is a restaurant owner. His restaurant is called ‘The Wow Bowl’. He was studying for a career in medicine when he discovered his interest and skills in cooking. He mixed his interest in medicine and his love for food, and came up with unique and healthy dishes. He mixed natural herbs and medicines in common food like dal-rice. This not only made it tasty, but also healed illnesses like common cold and cough. He wanted to turn this idea into a business. Immediately after completing his studies, he arranged some finance and started the restaurant. It was an interesting journey for him. He explains his journey of starting the business through these four steps as shown in Figure 4.6. In this session, you will learn about the first step of coming up with a business idea.

Page 20,"noteS What is a Business Idea? A business idea is a solution that an entrepreneur thinks of, to serve the customer. An idea determines what business activity an entrepreneur would take up to make financial gains. An idea can be product-service- based or a hybrid model. Principles of Idea Creation There are a few important principles to keep in mind while coming up with an idea. Customer Need An idea should serve the customer’s need or demand. A business idea can come from an existing demand in the market or through a desire to make what is available in the market, better. A product or service, which is either not meeting customer’s needs, or is partially meeting needs is available, so there is a demand to fill in the gap. Hence, an entrepreneur thinks of starting a business to meet this demand. For example, during the summer season, when the weather is very hot, people who walk in the sun, like students, workers, etc., want a cold drink to feel fresh, so an entrepreneur can start a sugarcane juice stall or a lemonade stall in a busy area. Entrepreneur’s Own Interest or Talent An entrepreneur often works with an idea that she or he is passionate about. Not all entrepreneurs start with just what is in demand or what the market needs. Some entrepreneurs start with using their own interest or talent to serve the customer. Knowing one’s interest or talent is in fact important for an entrepreneur as it leads to self-confidence and even others believing and trusting in their capabilities. For example, a girl who is studying to be a fashion designer can use her interest in the subject to start a shop where she sells different types of clothes. Innovative Innovative means new methods or original ideas. A business can be innovative in its idea or the way it is EmployabiliSkill– laSSXi 156",381
Page 21,"done. The chances of a business growing increases if n oteS the idea is innovative and the way it is implemented is also innovative. For example, in Vivek’s case, the food he serves in his restaurant is different and no one else sells food for people who are sick. Form a Business Idea Most ideas come from either needs of customer or inspiration from what others are doing. There are many ways in which one can come up with innovative, yet practical ideas for a business. Let’s practice a few ways to come up with ideas. Location-based Ideas An entrepreneur can come up with idea to serve needs of customer at a specific location. For example, in a small village in Rajasthan, where there is limited supply of pure drinking water, an entrepreneur can set up a business of selling water. Seasonal Ideas During summers, people want to drink cold, healthy drinks in big cities, while in winters, they like warm beverages. An entrepreneur can come up with the ideas based on the season. Events-based Ideas Another way to come-up with a business idea is to think of ways to serve the people at events. For example, there are different businesses that come up during the wedding season, like card-designers and printers, mehendi (henna) designers, event managers, decorators, etc. Interest-driven Ideas An entrepreneur can come-up withbusinessideasbased on self-interest. For example, someone who is good at dance and likes dancing, can start a dance-training institute for serious dancers and also for people who want to slim down by doing fun exercises. EntrEprEnEurshskills 157",346
Page 22,"Vocation-driven Ideas Many people start a business based on what they are interested in and what they have studied. A farmer, who knows everything about farming, from where to get the seeds, to how to plough the ground can start a Farmer Training Institute for those who want to learn about farming, or can guide city dwellers how to grow vegetables on terraces and balconies. Case Study Nagma, the Fashion Designer Nagma went to Chennai to become a fashion designer. She was always interested in designing beautiful dresses for her friends when she was in school. After college, Nagma was not sure what kind of work she should do. In Nagma’s culture, girls have to wear a scarf, or hijab at all times. In a city like Chennai, it was difficult for Nagma to find good quality hijabs, so she came up with an idea of making and selling them. She started making good-quality, fashionable and affordable hijabs. She would buy good material, stitch pearls and beads, and pack her products in a beautiful box. She would sell them in hostels and colleges. Now, Nagma has a boutique of her own and also sells products online. Rakesh, the Special Auto-wala Rakesh came from a small village in Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai when he was very young. He had come to make money for his family. His friends gave him an idea of buying an auto to make enough money. For many years, Rakesh was driving around like any other auto-wala. But with time, he really started enjoying his work. He loved talking to his customers and listening about their life. This gave him idea, which turned him from an auto-wala to an entrepreneur. EmployabiliSkill– laSSXi 158",369

People starting using Rakesh’s services, and would stand in ques to get one ride with him. Rakesh now has many auto-walas working under him. He has trained them to serve on the same standards to the customers. He has a flourishing business now. Anshula, the Story-teller Anshula, used to write story-books for young children, but she wanted to do more with her talent. She thought of an idea to start a reading-café, which would be a coffee shop where people, especially mothers, can bring their children to learn how to read books, while they enjoy coffee. When she started the shop, no one wanted to help her with teaching how to read to little children. But then she realised that young college-going boys and girls who often came to her shop, had free time. She trained them how to teach or read stories to young children. They were happy to help her in return for a certificate of service. Soon many mothers started coming to her shop with their children. She started only one shop near her house in Bengaluru, but now runs five such shops in three different cities. Thinking time 1.

Page 26,"N otes Customer Needs Customer needs can be categorised into four types of needs. (e) Served Needs: These are needs that customers know and are fulfilled by different businesses or the government. For example, the need of travelling from one place to the other is taken care of by both, private bus services and government bus services. (f) Partially-served Needs: These are needs which are served through different products or services, but the customer is not completely satisfied and still faces problems while using. For example, people always used taxis and autorickshaws to go to different places, but they face problem in finding one on time, and paying a reasonable amount for it. (g) Unserved and Known Needs: These needs are known by the customers, but not fulfilled by anyone in the market. For example, people in small towns do not have electricity supply at all times, and therefore their children cannot study after sunset. A company realised this problem and created solar-lamps, which get charged during the day and can be used at night. (h) Unknown Needs: These are needs that people have, but are not aware or do not expect for it to get solved by a business. For example, people 10 years ago did not know that it will be possible to make video-calls across cities or countries. But through innovation, entrepreneurs and innovators found the technology to make this happen. Aspects to Keep in Mind while Understanding Customer Needs The above mentioned needs about the specific product or service can be found out keeping in mind the following factors: (a) Quality and Quantity: An entrepreneur must understand what is a customer’s expectation in terms of the quality.For example, an entrepreneur EmployabilSkill– ClaSSXi 162",361
Page 27,"whomakesandsellsbiscuitsneedstounderstand n oteS which flavours the customers like, the level of sweetness that customers prefer, etc. (b) Price:An entrepreneur must understand at what price the customer will be willing to buy a product of a particular quality. Knowing this helps the entrepreneur to decide their profit margin, as well as think of methods to lower the cost of making the product without compromising on quality. (c) Location: Location means the place from where customers usually buy the product or service. For example, an entrepreneur who wants to sell beautifulhandmadejewellerymaythinkofsetting up a shop near a saree or women’s clothing store. The products may not sell if the shop is near a men’s clothing store. (d) Time: Time is also an important factor in understanding customer needs. An entrepreneur should understand in which season or at what time of the day, week or month, would a customer use the product or service. The production and advertisements can be planned accordingly (e) Frequency: Frequency means the number of times a customer may buy the product or service. Some products are bought again and again, while others are bought once in a few years. For products like food items, the same customer may buy a samosa every day from the same shop, but for a product like a battery operated fan, a customer will repurchase only in 5–6 years. Customer Survey Customer survey is an exercise that entrepreneurs do to understand whether there is a market for what they have to offer. Through this survey, entrepreneurs try to know whether they are meeting customer needs and also understand what their preferences are. Customer survey is one of the most effective ways to find out what customers want. It involves talking directly to customers and asking them questions. Later in this session, you will be doing an activity to practice taking a customer survey. EntrEprEnEurshskills 163",398
Page 28,"noteS Knowing Competitors for Understanding Supply Before an entrepreneur starts the business, another important step for understanding the market is to know which other businesses in the market are providing the same product or service. This helps an entrepreneur to understand the competition they might face. The key aspects to keep in mind while understanding your competitors are (a) Positioning: One should try and understand how the competitors position their business. This means, how the enterprise wants its customers to see them. One can be seen as a high-quality expensivebrand,ortheycanbeseenasalow-cost, affordable brand. This is important information for an entrepreneur who is starting new, since it allows them to decide how they would want their potential customers to see them. (b) Pricing: Pricing means an understanding of the price at which different competitors sell their product or service. Knowledge of competitor pricing helps the entrepreneur to decide the price and quality of their own products or service. (c) Offers:Thenextinformationthatanentrepreneur can find out is about the kind of offers that the competitors give to their customers, and why does a customer go to them again and again? This knowledge will give the entrepreneur ideas on how they can be different from their competitors. (d) Customer Relations: Another important information that must be understood at this stage ishowabusinessstaysintouchwithitscustomers and maintains a relationship with them, so that they keep coming back, giving repeat business. A Competition Survey In order to figure out what is available in the market and what the competitors are doing, an entrepreneur should study all possible businesses. In a customer survey, one directly goes and talks to the customer, but in a competition survey, an entrepreneur must observe and ask others these questions. Here is a sample survey questionnaire that can be used for a competition survey. EmployabiliSkill– laSSXi 164",385

Let us understand why planning is important. Business idea Improving Understand the growth in market business Business planning Figure 4.10 The business cycle 166 EmployabiliSykill– ClaSSXi",216
Page 31,"Importance of Planning A business plan is important for an entrepreneur. Some of the reasons why a business plan should be prepared are as follows: (a) Estimating the money required to be spent: Once the entrepreneur knows what product to sell and whom to sell it to, the next step is to estimate how much money will be required to start the business. Without an estimate of how much money is required, an entrepreneur might invest too much money, or may start the business without enough money to run the business. (b) Estimating quantity of material required: Knowing how much material is required helps an entrepreneur decide the cost of making each product or cost of delivering the service. (c) Standing out: A business plan also makes an entrepreneurplanhowtheycanmakethecustomer see the business as standing out uniquely when compared with competitors. (d) Setting goals:Another important reason of having a plan is to set ambitious, yet realistic goals. These goals motivate the entrepreneur to work hard. Business Plan A business plan is a detailed plan of what an entrepreneur wants to achieve through the business and how it will be achieved. While planning for a business, an entrepreneur has to think about different factors. Below is the sample template which can be used to plan for a small business.

Improving and Growing Business After starting the business, an entrepreneur has to think about how they can continue to improve and grow by creating value for the customer. There are mainly three principles which can be followed to grow a business. Principles (a) Quality: An entrepreneur can improve the businessbyimprovingthequalityoftheproductor service which is offered to the customer. This will help the business to stand out in the market and as a result, will justify the entrepreneur charging a higher price. More inflow of money will help the business to grow. For example, for a business of candles, an entrepreneur can improve on the quality by making scented candles or candles in different colours or sizes. (b) Scaling Up: Scaling up means growing the business by attracting more customers. There are many ways a business can reach out to more and more customers. One such way is to go to a different area where you will find new customers. For example, selling candles in different housing societies where a lot of people live instead of market where there is competition. (c) Adding Substitutes: Another way of growing a business is by giving offers to customers. Substitutes mean products and services which are similar to what is already being sold. For example,sellingcandlestandsalongwithcandles. 168 EmployabiliSkillS– ClaSXi",368
Page 33,"Case Study n oteS Richa started a candle making business to help her earn enough money for her college fees. A friend informed her about a candle making workshop, and even though it was quite far, she attended the workshop and learnt the art of candle making. She saved `2000 over a few months, and bought raw materials — wax, wicks, molds and containers and dyes. She had enough material for making 200 candles. In the beginning, she made many mistakes and a lot of work had to be re-done. Making one candle took her 20 minutes. She was able to make only 70 candles. She tried selling the candles for `50 each, but realised that the price in the market for similar candles was only `25. She decided to sell for `20. What could she do now? How could she create more value?
